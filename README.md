# Module 1 Challenge - Horiseon Code Refactoring

## Description

In order to improve future collaboration on teh Horiseon homepage, I've consolidated and reorganized the CSS selectors to better match the flow of the HTML, and improved the semantics of the both the HTML and CSS code. 

This should make future changes to the webpage easier to manage, and should be easier to read for anyone working on this page going forward. 

By renaming the many div tags in the HTML, the code should be easier to follow and compare to the CSS style sheet, and will make the CSS style sheet easier to understand.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

All links in the nagivation bar at the top of the page will now work correctly to jump the user to the corresponding location on the page. 

Alt tags have been added to each image on the page, as well as an aria tag for the background image at the top.
